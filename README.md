Just learned this MERN stack tutorial from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA).
Updating this repository means I added a little flair every now and then to improve interface or experience.

Environment, tools, libraries, and frameworks used:

For Backend
- NodeJS
- Express
- Nodemon
- MongoDB (local server)
- Mongoose
- CORS
- Postman

For Frontend
- Vite + React (w/ Javascript)
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Axios
- React Icons
- Notistack

The approach here was to create two separate folders for backend and frontend. The backend is created first and tested with Postman then a frontend folder is created and configured with Vite + React installation.
